*************************************************
* The program works from the subject line   	*
* It will search what ever you put in there 	*
* and then return the results against the   	*
* list of files at hand.                    	*
*						*
* To set up, you will have to create folder	*
* called "MSDS" and this is where your files	*
* will be kept.  This will be changed shortly.	*
*						*
* To add a file thru email, put "***add"	*
* in the subject line, and have files you want 	*
* to add attached.				*
* I don't know how it will perform with no files*
*						*
* You need an email account with SMTP and IMAP	*
* access, this is configured in config.php	*
* 						*
* Currently this program works only when called *
* ex// php autosender.php       		*
* Try 						*
* watch -n 10 "php automsds.php >> runlog.txt"	*
* to put it into a continual state		*
* 						*
